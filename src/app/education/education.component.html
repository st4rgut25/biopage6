<h3>Hi, I'm Edward, the creator of this site and a budding data-viz journalist.

<h3>
I've worked on quite a few projects and can appreciate high quality, intercative visualizations.

<h3>
I love visiting the LA Times, New York Times and The Guardian for their awesome graphics. Outside of eyeballing bars and charts, I mountain bike - with a helmet of course!</h3>
